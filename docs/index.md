## Gotham

Gotham is an app for [elementary OS](https://www.elementary.io) that forces dark mode for non-curated Flatpak apps (i.e., from flathub or elsewhere). This explicitly doesn't force dark mode on apps from the AppCenter. This also doesn't support apps installed from .deb files due to technical restrictions.

### Getting Gotham

Gotham is exclusively distributed via a custom Flatpak remote.
